# Studynomics-App
## Dev: Renato Opazo Salgado
For the course 1DV430 at Linnaeus University.

I build an android application written in Kotlin. This app was a try off making it mvvm before I participated in the mvc course 1DV607 - Object Oriented Analysis and Design at Linnaeus University. 

Will continue this application base functions as a webapp in another repo. 

### Background

First I will describe how the study life works in Sweden. After that I will describe my problem that my app fixes. 

#### How study finance works in Sweden 
In Sweden, we have The Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN).

This is what they write in their homepage about them self:

>  The Swedish Board of Student Finance (CSN) is the government agency that manages Swedish student finance, i.e. grants and loans for studies. 

So the Swedish students gets a bit money, one part grant and one part loan (today the interest is at 0,36%), from the government to finance their studies. 

Very generous by the government to do that. They of course have theirs demands.

1) If you seek for studies at 100% pace then you should study in that pace.

2) To ensure that you are using your time to study and not working. They put an income cap depending on your pace. 

They have other demands but this app just take care of point 2.

#### Leave from work to study.

In Sweden, if you have been employed in the same company more than 6 months you can take a study leave. If possible, you can decide the amount of leave. 

#### The problem that my app fixes.

When I created the app I had taken a study leave from my work for only 88.5%. And got 100% study grant and loan from the government. As I worked for 11.5% I was afraid of passing the income cap. And if that would happen it would be an economic problem for me.

 ### Functions
 
 Here you can see how the app worked at august 2019.

 The functions:
 1) Calculate how much you have left if you take X% of study leave from work.
 2) Calculate how much you have left after taxes depending on your municipality.
 3) Calculate how much more you can earn per month wily studying.
